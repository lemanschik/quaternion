## Supported Embeddings
To give you out of the box Embeddings without much overhead we support chromadb and other vector databases the default local quaternion deployment ships with chromadb per app model instances. So that your data gets not mixed up. 
It is designed to get you up and running quickly to experiment and code your software so that you then can later deploy to production and scale the knowledge bases.

## Large Scale Enterprise Deployments
You should consider getting consulting about that when your software works later at big scale as it needs much knowledge to deploy large scale RAG Applications.
